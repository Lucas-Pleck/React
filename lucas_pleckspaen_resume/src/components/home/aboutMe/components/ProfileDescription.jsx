    I have a curious mind that makes me keen to learn, adapt and grow. My experience as a
    marketeer, webshop owner, sales representative and area manager allowed me to acquire
    solid soft & hard skills. <br /> Long passionate about information technology and
    always looking for new challenges, I decided to reorient my career in this sector in
    May 2021. Since then, I followed DevOps specialization courses as well as a technical
    and network support training. Furthermore I have acquired a solid knowledge of other
    technologies and methodologies on my own.
